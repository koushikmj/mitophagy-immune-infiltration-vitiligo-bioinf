Mitophagy and Immune Infiltration in Vitiligo — Colab Notebook

Overview

Single Jupyter notebook that replicates and critiques a 2023 bioinformatics study on mitophagy and immune infiltration in vitiligo using GEO microarray data. The notebook performs preprocessing, batch correction, DEG discovery, mitophagy-gene overlap (KEGG hsa04137), enrichment (GO/KEGG/GSEA), PPI export, ML-based hub gene selection (LASSO, Random Forest), immune deconvolution, and ROC diagnostics. Designed to run end-to-end on Google Colab with minimal setup.

What this notebook includes

• Data download (GEO), normalization, and ComBat batch correction with PCA/QC.

• DEG analysis with limma via rpy2 or Python analogs; thresholds p&lt;0.05 and |log2FC|&gt;0.5, plus sensitivity runs.

• Enrichment: GO/KEGG (clusterProfiler) and GSEA (fgsea).

• PPI: STRING queries and Cytoscape-ready exports (optional visualization step).

• ML hub genes: LASSO (glmnet) and Random Forest; consensus intersection.

• Immune deconvolution (GSVA/ssGSEA signatures) and ROC/AUC with pROC.

• Reproducibility notes and divergences from the paper.

Datasets

• GSE53146 (5 vitiligo, 5 healthy) and GSE75819 (paired lesional/non-lesional; n=30).

• Mitophagy gene set: KEGG hsa04137 (72 genes).

Open in Colab

• Upload the .ipynb to Google Drive and open with Google Colab, or drag-drop into Colab.

• First cell installs all dependencies automatically. Runtime: Python 3.10+,,R

One-click setup (first cell runs)

• Installs system and R deps, then Python packages:

• R: limma, sva, preprocessCore, clusterProfiler, org.Hs.eg.db, fgsea, GSVA, glmnet, randomForest, pROC.

• Python: rpy2, pandas, numpy, scipy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, statsmodels, gseapy, requests, biopython.

• Config variables for dataset IDs, thresholds, seeds, and mitophagy gene list path/URL.

How to run

1\. Open the notebook in Colab and run the “Setup” cell to install dependencies.

2\. Run “Download & prepare data” to fetch GEO matrices and metadata.

3\. Execute “Preprocess & batch correct” to normalize and run ComBat; review PCA plots.

4\. Run “DEG analysis” and “Enrichment & GSEA” sections.

5\. Run “PPI export” and “Hub gene selection (LASSO/RF).”

6\. Execute “Immune deconvolution” and “ROC diagnostics.”

7\. Review the “Reproducibility & divergence notes.”

Key parameters (editable in notebook)

• deg_pval: 0.05; deg_log2fc: 0.5; alt thresholds for sensitivity (e.g., log2fc=0.2, p=0.1).

• batch_var: dataset/source; design: group (lesional/nonlesional/control).

• lasso: 10-fold CV; RF: ntree=1000, tuned mtry; seed=12345.

Outputs (saved to /content/results)

• QC (density, PCA), volcano/heatmaps, DEG tables.

• GO/KEGG dotplots, GSEA plots.

• STRING edges/nodes TSVs, hub-gene tables (LASSO, RF, intersection).

• Immune scores, group comparisons, gene–immune correlations.

• ROC curves and AUCs for single and multigene models.

Notes on findings to expect

• GSE75819 yields robust DEGs consistent with the paper; GSE53146 is underpowered and may need relaxed thresholds for exploration.

• Hub genes in this replication often include BCL2L1, MTX2, RPS27A, TAX1BP1, USP8; paper reported GABARAPL2, SP1, USP8, RELA, TBC1D17.

Limitations

• Microarray platform differences and probe mapping can affect combined analyses.

• Some Cytoscape visualizations are optional and not executed within Colab.
